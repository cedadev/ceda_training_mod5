      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to follow the exercises in this module you will need access to a UNIX environment with several specific tools installed.  We recommend 2 options:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. You can install the [JASMIN Analysis Platform (JAP)](http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/cedaservices/wiki/JASMIN/AnalysisPlatform) on your Redhat Linux computer (CentOS or RHEL).\n",
      " \n",
      " 2. You can get ann account on the [JASMIN Infrastructure](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk)\n",
      " \n",
      "### Option 1: Getting JAP\n",
      " \n",
      "  We provide two easy ways of getting started with a JASMIN Analysis Platform environment. If you want to evaluate the environment you can install a virtual machine within your desktop or laptop. This method will work with any operating system compatible with VirtualBox.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also install the RPMs onto an existing system. RPMs are available for Red hat Enterprise Linux 6 or a binary-compatible alternative such as CentOS 6.4.\n",

      "### Option 2: Getting on JASMIN\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven't registered for access to [JASMIN](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk) follow the [instructions on the CEDA website](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/help/users-guide/jasmin-cems-access/).  This should lead you through creating an `ssh` key pair which is used to login to JASMIN.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First ensure your `ssh-agent` is running and has your key installed.  The `ssh-agent` is a small program which remembers your key during your desktop session.  Depending on your desktop operating system it may already be running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use the `ssh-add -l` command to check whether ssh-agent is running.\n",

      "```\n",
      "$ ssh-agent bash\n",
      "$ ssh-add\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now check that your key pair is in the the correct place.  Both the files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` should be in the directory `~/.ssh/`.  Once they are there you can add the key using `ssh-add`\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
